# Unconference

## compiled docs

- Pamflet: exposes comments and docs as a nice web site
  - dispatch and unfiltered docs are built with it
- scaladoc
  - it'd be nice to show inner classes in scaladoc, or at least searchable
  - introduce [sbt-doctest](https://github.com/tkawachi/sbt-doctest) as build time verifying of examples
  - reference test examples as docs

## cake pattern / modules
